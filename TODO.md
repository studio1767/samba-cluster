# To Do List

In it's current state, this is a fairly basic setup. There are lot of things still left to do which
I'll get back to when I have time.

The list includes:

* fixup the idmapping of built-in users to match in each server
* setup sysvol replication
* setup secure LDAP with TLS
* add an admin machine to each VPC
* create some tools for managing users
* add a test machine in each VPC
* ability to login using samba user accounts
